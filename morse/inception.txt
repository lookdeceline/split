Do you remember from before this dream
Rain gunfire Uncle Peter Christ weve been kidnapped
Where were they holding you
They had us in the back of a van
Your bodys bouncing around in the back of a van right now that explains the gravity shifts
It was to do with a safe Christ why is it so hard to remember
Its like trying to remember a dream after youve woken up It takes years of practice to do it easily So you and Browning have been pulled into this dream so they can steal something from your mind What
They wanted a combination to a safe they demanded the first numbers to pop into my head
Thats them extracting a locator
locator
number from your own subconscious
It can be used any number of ways This is a hotel Room numbers What was the number you gave them
Two something it was a long number Five two eight four something
Well we know where to start Fifth floor
